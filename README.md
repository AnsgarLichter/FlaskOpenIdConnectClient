# FlaskOpenIdConnectClient

This repository contains a proof of concept for an OpenID Connect client in Python with Flask.
This PoC is needed for an university project.

## Authlib

This PoC uses [Authlib](https://authlib.org/) as a library to make the implementation easier. Authlib is used because the university
project has already used Authlib for other scenarios.
